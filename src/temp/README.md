# Refactoring The Code

This is a temporary directory that holds the new code for Pulsar as I refactor it and add an Abstract Syntax Tree step in the parsing. I will move all these files to the main directory once my work here is done.

## temp.pulsar
This holds all of the source code for the compiler pipeline.

## temp.ast
This holds all of the Abstract Syntax Tree nodes produced by the Abstract Syntax Tree Class.
