Pulsar is a new programming language designed to have a clear, concise, and readable syntax. This is the second official implementation, rewritten in C++ instead of Java. It features both a compiler, which will compile down to native code, and an interpreter, both of which are currently being developed.

## Features
As of now, the following features are working:
- Expressions (Including Basic Arithmetic Operators)
- Local Variables
- Global Variables
- If/Else Statements
- While Loops
- User Defined Functions

## TODO
The following things are currently being worked upon:
- Bytecode/AST Optimizations
- A Standard Library
- A Working Compiler
