# Pulsar

Pulsar is a new programming language that aims to be as
* powerful as Java,
* simple as Python,
* fast as C,
* safe as Rust,

eventually.

This is the first implementation, written in Java with a bit of Kotlin. It features both a compiler, which will compile down to native code, and an interpreter, both of which are currently being developed.

## Features
As of now, the following features are working:
- Global Variables
- Local Variables (Including Constants)
- If/Else Statements
- While Loops
- Expressions (Including Basic Arithmetic Operators)

## TODO
The following things are currently being worked upon:
- A Double Pass Compiler (AST + Bytecode)
- A Working Compiler
- User Defined Functions
- Native Functions

### Current Version: 0.0.5
