# Pulsar
Pulsar is a new programming language that aims to be as
* powerful as Java,
* simple as Python,
* fast as C,
* safe as Rust,

eventually.

This is the first implementation, written in Java with a bit of Kotlin. It features both a compiler, which will compile down to native code, and an interpreter, both of which are currently being developed.
