Pulsar is a new programming language that I am currently working on to learn how compilers and interpreters work as well as for a personal challenge. This is the first implementation, written in Java with a bit of Kotlin. It features both a compiler, which will compile down to native code, and an interpreter, both of which are currently being developed.

(Note: In preparation for Version 0.1.0, the compiler is being rewritten in C++. The Java/Kotlin code will be removed one this is done.)

## Features
As of now, the following features are working:
- Expressions (Including Basic Arithmetic Operators)
- Local Variables
- Global Variables
- If/Else Statements
- While Loops

## TODO
The following things are currently being worked upon:
- A Working Compiler
- Bytecode/AST Optimizations
- User Defined Functions
- Native Functions

### Current Version: 0.0.6
