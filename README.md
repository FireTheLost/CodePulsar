# Pulsar

Pulsar is a new programming language that aims to be as easy to use and learn as possible.

This is the first implementation, written in Java with a bit of Kotlin. It features both a compiler, which will compile down to native code, and an interpreter, both of which are currently being developed.

## Features
As of now, the following features are working:
- Expressions (Including Basic Arithmetic Operators)
- Local Variables (Including Constants)
- If/Else Statements
- While Loops

## TODO
The following things are currently being worked upon:
- A Symbol Table And Static Analysis
- A Working Compiler
- Bytecode/AST Optimizations
- User Defined Functions
- Native Functions

### Current Version: 0.0.5
